Earth observation is essentially the collection of chemical, physical, and biological information about the earth using remote sensing. Remote sensing is the acquisition of information without physical contact i.e. remotely. The rest of this document will be a brief introduction into the sources of earth observation data, remote sensing, and their uses.

The most common and open source of remote sensing data is the use of Satellites. The European Space Agency (ESA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) offer data from various satellites for free. The ESA have a series of satellites called Sentinels which capture images for land and ocean monitoring. Information regarding sea-surface topography, sea and land temperature, ocean colour, land colour, land vegetation, soil and water cover, aerosol movements, and air quality can be attained depending on the satellite used. NASA have their own collection of satellites which monitor various aspects of the earth. Both NASA and ESA offer data freely on their websites. This method of remote sensing is typically refered to as passive as the source of the measurement is due to the sun i.e. the sun light bouncing off the earth's surface and hitting the satellite. 

Other methods of earth observation include active emission of radiation. They emit the radiation and measure how this radiation is reflected from a target. Examples of such methods are Radio Dection and Ranging (RADAR) and Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR). RADAR emits radio waves and measures their reflection. LiDAR uses light in the form of a laser to measure distances. When emitted from a known location, using GPS, and using the time it takes between the emission and return of the pulse allows highly precise mapping of 3D surfaces to be constructed. This can be used to create a very accurate topography map.

Uses of remote sensing data has almost no bounds. It is used in nutrient analysis, deforestation, and burn scar mapping in forestry, agriculture, urban planning, flood risk analysis, insurance, search and rescue, oil spill detection, and ice cap area monitoring to name just a few. There are some issues related to earth observation such as the image resolution. The Sentinel 2 images below have a resolution of 10x10m pixels so if the phenomena to be observed is less than this area then it will be diffucult to view. Another aspect that impedes earth observation is cloud cover. 

The Sentinel 2 satellite is an optical imagery satellite so if there is cloud cover between it and the earth's surface then it will be very diffucult to remove it. Other problems with earth observation images are cloud shadow, temporal resolution (i.e. the time it takes for the satellite to return to the same area to take another photo so that a change between the two can be detected), and of course no images can be taken during no day light hours (RADAR saatellites can be used during all hours of the day).

The example to be shown will be the processing of a burn scar map for the Cloosh forest in Galway. There will be  four images, one before the fire, one after the fire, a Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) image (which enhances the vegetation in the image), and then a classified image.

The image below is a Red, Green, Blue or true colour image of the Cloosh area in Galway before the fire. This image can be freely downloaded from the Sentinel 2 database using www.scihub.copernicus.eu as can any other images of Ireland. Cloosh is a forest with various roads through it for wind turbines. All of the dark green pixels are really healthy forest stands, and the lighter shaded green pixels are not so healthy with brown coloured pixels showing bare soil.

This net image is an image of the same area post fire. As you can see some of the dark green pixels in the previous picture as now coloured brown or darker in colour due to the fire burning the trees.

This next image is of NDVI where the darker the areas the more intensly the fire burned.

Finally, using a classification algorithim called random forest and training the algorithim to distinguish between unburned, lightly burned, and severly burned we get this image where red is severly burned, orange is low severity burn and yellow is unburned.
